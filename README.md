# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-
EDA and comparison of the performance of different ML algorithms

Here, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UC
Irvine Machine Learning Repository has been used. The “Original” dataset, as created from 
the reports of Dr. William H. Wolberg (University of Wisconsin Hospitals, 
Madison), contains instances of data added chronologically in groups, with 699 
points as of 1992. This only contained 9 features of integer datatype. The 
“Diagnostic” dataset was brought out in late 1995 and contains 569 instances with 
30 real-type features, no missing values and, most notably, the diagnosis- ‘M’ for 
‘Malignant” and “B” for “Benign”. The features were computed from digitized 
images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass, and describe the characteristics 
of the cell nuclei present in the images. Features include smoothness, compactness, 
concavity, texture, radius and concave points among others.
